#+title: Setup-General
* What Does it Do?
Setup-General provides adapted versions of setup's macros to work with general

* Requirements
The emacs packages [[https://git.sr.ht/~pkal/setup][setup]] & [[https://github.com/noctuid/general.el][general.el]]

* Usage
** Keybinding Macros
The keybinding macros only work with evil mode. If you aren't trying to bind keys for evil-mode, use the default =:bind=
=:with-state= is used like =:with-map=, but for evil states.
=:general= is this package's equivalent of =:bind=.

*Examples:*
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (:with-state 'normal
    (:with-map global-map
      (:general "k" 'evil-previous-visual-line
  	      "j" 'evil-next-visual-line)))
#+end_src

** Hook Macros
=:ghook= is like =:hook=, but with general-add-hook.
=:ghook-into= is like =:hook-into=, but with general-add-hook.
Both have the ability to use lists.

*Examples:*
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (:with-mode marginalia-mode
    (:ghook all-the-icons-completion-maraginalia-setup))

  (:ghook-into prog-mode))
#+end_src

* Credits
Every macro here is adapted from the macros found in setup. Very little has been changed.
